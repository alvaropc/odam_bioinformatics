This is my final practise of python.

As you can see there are two scripts here and also a folder.


In my final practise of python I tried to create a Parwise Alignment tool (see FinalPractise.pdf for more details), 
and here you can find all the files related to the practies.


PairwiseAlign.py works like a module, and contains the main code and functions of the practise, 
I invite you to work with the module in the console, based in a initial matrix, all the functions are easy to understand and to work with.


FinalPractise.py contain code for a Flask interface. 
This one is not full developed, but it is user-friendly and you can explore it if you want.


Inside the templates folder you can find the templates used by FinalPractise.py.


In order to know more about the main code, please, open the PairwiseAlign.py code and read the notes I put there.


I hope it will glad you.


Thank you.
Álvaro Ponce Cabrera
